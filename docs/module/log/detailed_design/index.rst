Detailed Design for Component: Log
==================================

Description
-----------

Log component consists of three units:

- `mw_log` - modelled after `log` Rust library.
- `mw_log_fmt` - replacement for `core::fmt` provided by Rust core library.
- `mw_log_macro` - replacement for `format_args` macro provided by Rust compiler.

Most common approach in Rust is that formatting always result in a string.
This leads to a `log` library to always receive a pre-formatted string.

Such approach is incompatible with the expectation that log sink is not always text-based.
Log component design is no longer string-based, and data frames can consist of multiple types.
Value is passed along with formatting options to the backend.

Rationale Behind Decomposition into Units
******************************************

All units provide an interface or an implementation to a well defined functionality.
Those units are not described in architecture, as they all form a monolithic logging frontend.

Such frontend shall remain transparent replacement to common functionalities provided by Rust.
